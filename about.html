                    My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. To all law enforcement entities, this is not an admission of guilt.
                     I am speaking to my family now. Skyler, you are the love of my life. I hope you know that. Walter Jr., you're my big man. There are going to be some things that you'll come to learn about me in the next few days.
                      But just know that no matter how it may look, I only had you in my heart. Goodbye.
                 </p>

                     Besides my love for Breaking Bad and other TV shows, I'm also a chronic gamer that goes to school half time, then complains that I have to go to work for 3 hours.
                      Based. I use words that are not in the english language and type incredibley slow for how long I've been interacting with computers. 
                      I also have several hobbies I often rotate through beides video games such as skating, painting, building model tanks, D&D, and cars. 
                      I am soon going to become poor aswell because college is gonna require me to sell my left kidney.

                <p  style="padding-top: 30px; font-size: larger;">
                    Computer science is something I'm not only passionate about but also something I'm pretty decent at.
                    Many of my classes taken in school and time spent at home has been with computers, both on the hardware side and the software side
                    which has helped me gain a borderline understanding of programming and computers.
