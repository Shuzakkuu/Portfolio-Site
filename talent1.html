            <a style="font-size:x-large;" href="https://shuzakkuu.github.io/Heber-Website/">Visit The Site!</a>
            <p style="padding-top:20px;">This was a large project I worked on which showcases some of my HTML and CSS skill. 
                It focusd on using high res optimized images to improve the user experience and ensure the website loads almost isntantly.
                 It also tested my abilty to use grids, background images, and overall design choice. </p>

            <h1>Shipping form template</h1>
            <a style="font-size:x-large;" href="https://shuzakkuu.github.io/Form-Site/">Visit The Site!</a>
            <p style="padding-top:20px;">This was a smaller project that tested my abilty to create a semi functional HTML forms page, and I think it turned out pretty good. 
                This project is a great template for other projects and websites where something like a shipping form for products would be necessary.  </p>
