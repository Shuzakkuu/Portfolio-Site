            <h1>My peak League rank</h1>
            <p style="padding-top: 20px;">
                My greatest life achievment surely is my lague rank. It showcases many important skills such as pain tolerance, the abilty to withstand extreme emotions such as dispair, hate, and regret, and finally the ability to showcase jsut how bad you are at league. 
                My peak rank is gold but i'm actually a challenger level player getting bogged down by iron level losers with alzheimers. I also have 1500 hours in the gme but still haven't reached plat.

            <h1>My wallet</h1>
            <p>Being a juiced up gamer also grants a unique skill that helps drain your wallet of cash from an endless supply of content. One big example is buying every years COD even though you said you wouldn't buy COD again but then you do an dnow you're down 70 bucks. 
                Or you could spend 500 dollars on in game skins to a get a small dopamine hit. Even a 10 dollar battlepass purchase contributes to your wallet slowly becoming empty. This skill possessed by gamers is only matched by people with credit card addictions and shopping addictions.

        <div class="talent2c">
            <h1>Sacrificing things for gaming</h1>
            <p>being a gamer also means you have the innate skill of sacrificing less important things for your grind. For example, missing dinner because you're in a ranked game only to lose the game anyway. Additionally, not going out with friends becasue you need to grind ranked is another prime example.</p>
